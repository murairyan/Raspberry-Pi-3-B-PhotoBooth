# Raspberry-Pi-3-B-PhotoBooth
The components needed for this Photo Booth project is as follows: a Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi camera, one button, one 4 digit seven segment display, and 
breadboard. Essentially, the design of this project was that the user would push a button which would then print "Get ready to SMILE!!" in the program.
Shortly after, the seven segment display board would count down from 5 to 0. Once the display hit 0, the camera would take one shot and wait another 5 
seconds before taking another. This process would go on four times in total, and after the four photos were taken, they would be stitched together leaving 
no white space between each photo. A frame was then added along with borders between each photo so that users could easily tell apart where a new photo 
began. The Seattle University Logo was place at the bottom right corner as a piece of decoration. The program would then ask the user what would their 
message be and a caption for their photo. Once the user inputted the message and caption of their choice, the photo would then be automatically sent to 
Twitter to be tweeted under a Twitter bot account that I had created. The project was a very important lesson because it strengthened my understanding of
how defining functions works which as a key component to this entire project. I had also learned that when it comes to working on rather larger-scale 
projects, it is vital that the coder writes out the steps for the project that will lead to a complete piece rather than working on it as a whole. It is 
best and easier to code when working on multiple small files and once the files work in accordance to the step they are assigned to, then you can put all 
under one file by using defining functions that call back to each function based on the order. The coding and wiring was done myself, but I had the 
guidance of my professor and the helpful aid of fellow classmates. One quote that clearly reflects what I had learned from this project is: 
"Less is more, and more is less."
